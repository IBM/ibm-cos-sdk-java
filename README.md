# IBM Cloud Object Storage - Java SDK

This package allows Java developers to write software that interacts with [IBM
Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/about-cos.html). It is a fork of [the ``AWS SDK for Java`` library](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java).

## Documentation

* [Core documentation for IBM COS](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/getting-started.html)
* [Code Examples](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/libraries?topic=cloud-object-storage-java#java-examples)
* [Java API reference documentation](https://ibm.github.io/ibm-cos-sdk-java)
* [REST API reference documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/api-reference/about-api.html)

Changes to the SDK are tracked in the [CHANGELOG.md][changes-file] file.

* [Building from source](#building-from-source)
* [Getting help](#getting-help)

## Quick start

You'll need:

* An instance of COS.
* An API key from [IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam/users_roles.html) with at least `Writer` permissions.
* The ID of the instance of COS that you are working with.
* Token acquisition endpoint
* Service endpoint

These values can be found in the IBM Cloud UI by [generating a 'service credential'](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/iam/service-credentials.html).

## Getting the SDK

The recommended way to use the IBM COS SDK for Java in your project is to consume it from Maven. Import the `ibm-cos-java-sdk` and specify the SDK Maven modules that your project needs in the dependencies:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.ibm.cos</groupId>
    <artifactId>ibm-cos-java-sdk</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Building from source

Once you check out the code from GitHub, you can build it using Maven:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

## Using a Service Credential

From Release 2.1.0 you can source credentials directly from a
[Service Credential](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/iam/service-credentials.html) JSON document
generated in the IBM Cloud console saved to `~/.bluemix/cos_credentials`. The SDK will automatically load these providing you
have not explicitly set other credentials during client creation.
If the Service Credential contain [HMAC keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/hmac/credentials.html)
the client will use those and authenticate using a signature, otherwise the client will use the provided API key to authenticate
using bearer tokens.

## Archive Tier Support

You can automatically archive objects after a specified length of time or after a specified date.  Once archived, a temporary copy of an object can be restored for access as needed.  Restore time may take up to 15 hours.

An archive policy is set at the bucket level by calling the `setBucketLifecycleConfiguration` method on a client instance.  A newly added or modified archive policy applies to new objects uploaded and does not affect existing objects.  For more detail, [see the documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/libraries/java.html#java).

## Immutable Object Storage

Users can configure buckets with an Immutable Object Storage policy to prevent objects from being modified or deleted for a defined period of time.
The retention period can be specified on a per-object basis, or objects can inherit a default retention period set on the bucket. It is also possible
to set open-ended and permanent retention periods. Immutable Object Storage meets the rules set forth by the SEC governing record retention, and
IBM Cloud administrators are unable to bypass these restrictions. For more detail, [see the documentation][immutable-storage-docs].
Immutable Object Storage does not support Aspera transfers via the SDK to upload objects or directories at this stage.

## Accelerated Archive

Users can set an archive rule that would allow data restore from an archive in 2 hours or 12 hours.

## LEGACY: Aspera high-speed transfer

Aspera high-speed transfer through the COS SDK using the `cos-aspera` library is now legacy. New users and applications should use the [Aspera Transfer SDK](https://developer.ibm.com/apis/catalog/aspera--aspera-transfer-sdk/Introduction) instead. Existing users should begin new projects with the Aspera Transfer SDK and make plans to migrate existing applications. Users who use S3 for transfers and do not install `cos-aspera` are unaffected.
