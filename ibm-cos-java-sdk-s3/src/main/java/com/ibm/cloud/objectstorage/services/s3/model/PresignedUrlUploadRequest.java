/**
 * Request class to upload a object to S3 using presigned urls. Upload content can be provided through a file or input stream.
 *
 * The behavior is similar to using {@link PutObjectRequest}. Depending on whether a file or input stream is being uploaded,
 * this request has slightly different behavior.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When uploading a file:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * The client automatically computes a checksum of the file. Amazon S3 uses
 * checksums to validate the data in each file.</li>
 * <li>
 * Using the file extension, Amazon S3 attempts to determine the correct content
 * type and content disposition to use for the object with some exceptions. See below.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If the given presigned url is created using <b>SigV2 signer</b> and content type is not provided,
 * then SDK will not attempt to determine the content type and instead sends an empty string for content type.
 * This is because content type is signed header in SigV2 and so the content type can only be sent
 * if it is used in creating presigned url.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If the given presigned url is created using <b>SigV4 signer</b>, then SDK attempts to determine
 * the correct content type and sends it with the request if not provided. Note that this only works
 * if you have not used content type while creating the presigned url. If you have used content type while
 * creating the url, then you should set the same content type while making this API call through
 * {@link PresignedUrlUploadRequest#setMetadata(ObjectMetadata)} or
 * {@link PresignedUrlUploadRequest#putCustomRequestHeader(String, String)}
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If Amazon S3 receives multiple write
 * requests for the same object nearly simultaneously, all of the objects might
 * be stored. However, only one object will obtain the key.
 * </p>
 *
 * If custom headers are used in generating the url, you can set them through {@link #putCustomRequestHeader(String, String)}
 * method. If any signed headers or parameters are missing from the request, a Signature mismatch error will be thrown from S3.
 * Ensure you set all the custom headers/parameters that are used for creating the presigned url.
